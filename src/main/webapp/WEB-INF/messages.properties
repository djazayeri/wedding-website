travel.flights.heading=Flights
travel.flights.text=<p>Flights are much cheaper and more convenient the earlier you book them, so book soon!</p><p>The airport code in Cali is CLO. You should try to fly directly to Cali. (Darius calls Bogota "the most chaotic airport I've ever been to".) The best options coming from the US probably involve the flights: AA 202, AV 39, or CM 645.</p>
travel.flights.shuttle=<p>To book a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, email Maribel at <a href="mailto:marveltours@hotmail.com">marveltours@hotmail.com</a>. (It should cost 35,000 COP per person, or 60,000 COP if you're the only person arriving on a flight.)</p>

travel.cali.text=<p>Cali was founded in 1536, by the Spanish conquistador Sebastian de Belalcázar. Its name comes from the native Indian tribe "Calima".</p> \
<p>Today, Cali is Colombia's third largest city, with an economy based on sugar plantations and the textile industry. \
Cali is also known as the capital of salsa dancing, and is nicknamed "Sucursal del Cielo" (approximately: "Branch Office of Heaven")</p> \
<p>Average temperatures in March are a high of 88 F (31 C) and a low of 67 F (19 C). The rainy season starts in April, but we can't guarantee a dry March.</p>

He's an amazing hairdresser, well-known in Cali, who specializes in styling for beauty queens and models. Makeup costs ~60,000 COP, and hair styling costs ~40,000 COP. Please <a href="mailto:campodejazayeri@gmail.com">email Monica</a> by March 15 if you'd like us to make you an appointment.</p>

If you're not on this list, you need to contact your closest Colombian consulate about getting a tourist visa.

quiz.1.question=Where did Darius and Monica meet?
quiz.1.answers="At a Bar", "In Prison", "In Costume", "All of the above", "None of the above"
quiz.1.correctAnswer=4
quiz.1.correctMessage=Correct! <p>We met at the Liberty Hotel in Boston, which was a jail until 1990.</p> <p>It was the day after Halloween, and Darius was dressed as the chef from Ten Tables.</p>

quiz.2.question=Where did Darius and Monica have their second date?
quiz.2.answers="Florence, Italy", "Kigali, Rwanda", "Boston, USA", "Hluhluwe Umfolozi, South Africa"
quiz.2.correctAnswer=4
quiz.2.correctMessage=Correct! <p>Three days after we met, Monica went to Italy for two weeks, and Darius went to Rwanda for a month.</p> <p>We finally had a <i>first</i> date in Boston a month later, but then Monica went to South Africa for two months.</p> <p>Fate smiled on us, and Darius got invited to Durban (for work! really, I promise!) and we went on a weekend safari in Hluhluwe Umfolozi.</p>

quiz.3.question=How did we end up in Seattle?
quiz.3.answers="Monica's parents were against the relationship, so she had to move to the opposite coast", "Monica was testing Darius to see if he was really interested", "Darius likes the rain", "Darius was commissioned to start an OpenMRS branch in Seattle", "Monica got into the fellowship program at the University of Washington"
quiz.3.correctAnswer=5
quiz.3.correctMessage=Correct! <p>Ever since she was a little girl, wearing her red cross apron, Monica has always wanted to be a pulmonologist. She matched with the pulmonary and critical care fellowship at the University of Washington before we met.</p> <p>After being in Boston since 1996, Darius was just waiting for the right girl to give him an excuse to move away.</p>

quiz.4.question=Who is most likely to be working at 6am?
quiz.4.answers="Monica", "Darius"
quiz.4.correctAnswer=2
quiz.4.correctMessage=Correct! <p>Darius has been working for Partners in Health since he graduated. He loves his job, programming electronic medical records for developing countries, and he's been lucky enough to be able to continue doing it remotely from Seattle.</p> <p>Unfortunately, coordinating a team spread out between Seattle, Indianapolis, Poland, Kenya, and Uganda means that the westernmost person has to start very early!</p>

quiz.5.question=What sort of things do we enjoy doing together?
quiz.5.answers="Tango Dancing", "Cooking", "Playing volleyball", "Collecting stamps", "Massage therapy"
quiz.5.correctAnswer=1
quiz.5.correctMessage=Correct! \
<p>Monica loves massages, while Darius is more active and plays volleyball. Nobody collects stamps.</p> \
<p>In the kitchen, Darius believes that to create a masterpiece, you must make a floor-to-ceiling mess. Monica tries clean up after him, but eventually either she gives up, or gets kicked out for trying to clean the spoon out of Darius's hand.</p> \
<p>On our trip to Buenos Aires we discovered that tango dancing is awesome. Ever since, we have been taking lessons and enjoying Seattle's surprisingly-vibrant milonga scene.</p>
